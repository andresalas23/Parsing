 
 
The script that you want is called (full_log_parsing.py).

The other files are just pieces of the code that i was working on before
I combined all of the scripts into one.

1. Download the file
2.I would put the file (full_log_parsing.py) into its own folder before executing it, because
  it will download the log file once. Then it will also make 12 additional files for one of the questions.
3.Run the script 
4.All answers will be answered via the script.
5.ENJOY
